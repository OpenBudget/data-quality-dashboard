## What is a "schema"?

A schema is a description of what a given data structure (e.g. a
single CSV file) should look like.  Any deviation between the schema
and the actual data structure could mean that manual work must be done
to "correct" the data structure.

## How does the scoring system work?

## What does "correct" mean?

"Correct" means 100% compliant with the specified schema.
